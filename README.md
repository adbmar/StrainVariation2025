Code and data repository for project investigating effects of rhizobial strain and plant host genetic variation on plant-nematode interactions using quantitative genetic methods. Code is set up such that the whole directory should be downloaded as one directory. Running the LoadData.R file will load appropriate data files (CSVs, etc.) into memory. Note that the script uses the location of the script to set a home directory and looks for the data files in that directory. After running the LoadData.R file you can run the other R files to run different analyses. Note that the PathAnalysis.R script must be run after the Analysis.R script. The GenotypeSelection directory within the main directory contains scripts and data used in the process of selecting genotypes for this study.

Manuscript for this study is currently being submitted for review.
